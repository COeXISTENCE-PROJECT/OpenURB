### (MA)RL algorithms and baselines.

We deliver here scripts for the experiment runs. Each associated with selected implementation of `torchRL` algorithm:
* IPPO
* IQL

We selected four most promising RL algorithms implemented in `TorchRL` applicable for the class of `urb` problems. You can tune them, adjust, hyperparameterize and modify, or create own scripts.

Apart from RL immplementations we provide baseline algorithms to compare with:
* a
* b
* c
