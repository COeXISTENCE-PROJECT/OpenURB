### Networks and demand patterns
----

**U**rban **R**outing **B**enchmark can be executed on a wide set of networks coupled with demand patterns.

We deliver:
* [RouteRL](https://github.com/COeXISTENCE-PROJECT/RouteRL) networks
* some [RESCO](https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO) networks - those on which routing is possible
* set of 25 small cuts from Ile-de-France - based on the synthetic agent based model.

You can `urb` on your cusom `OSM` downloaded or hand-made `SUMO` network with a demand pattern taken from custom source. For compatibility consult [RouteRL documentation](https://coexistence-project.github.io/RouteRL/)
